    <h3>What Is A Hackathon?</h3>
    <p>A hackathon is a team (1-4) competition to create an innovative solution to a specific world problem, for example: world hunger, water polution, or accesability for the disabled(we will have a seperate specific question). Obviously you are not going to find THE solution for a problem that has stricken the world for ages, but it is your job to find an innovative way to help. With hours of time to brainstorm, create, and model, you will present to a panel of judges and recieve awards and prizes if you win. During the day, we will provide food and snacks, activities to earn more prizes, skill workshops to help with your project, and free goodies from our sponsors.</p>
    
    <p>If coding isn't your cup of tea, that's no problem. You can make a prototype of a physical device, a website (easier than you think, we will have a workshop teaching you how), a game, or anything you can think of. We will have volunteers and people knowledgable in the field to help you with your project.</p>

    
    <h3>What Is The Problem We Are Solving? </h3>
    <p>To prevent participants from getting a head start in the planing stage, we will release the problem during the opening ceremony. Bring your thinking caps because it will be a busy day. </p>
